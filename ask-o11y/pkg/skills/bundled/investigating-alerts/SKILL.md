  Investigates firing alerts and incidents and drives root cause analysis
  across metrics, logs, and traces, prioritizing the alert's runbook. Use
  when the user mentions alerts, incidents, firing notifications, outages,
  or asks to find the root cause of a problem.

    Investigate the alert "{{.AlertName}}" and perform root cause analysis.

    **Efficiency:** Treat this alert name and any labels on its rule or firing instance as the primary scope. Prefer **targeted** metrics and logs for the affected service or namespace over unfocused cluster-wide listing. Combine related queries where one PromQL or LogQL answers several checks.

    **Your first step:** Find this alert by checking both:
    1. Prometheus datasource alerts (list datasources once to get the Prometheus UID; reuse it)
    2. Grafana-managed alerts

    When listing Prometheus datasource rules, filter with `label_selectors` (e.g. `label_selectors: ["alertname=\"{{.AlertName}}\""]`) — do **not** use `search_rule_name`: it is silently ignored on the datasource rules path and returns every rule in the datasource.

    Once you find the alert, check its annotations for a runbook URL (commonly `runbook_url`). If present, **fetch and read the runbook before** broader metrics/logs/trace exploration. Use the appropriate tool for the URL type (e.g., web_fetch for HTTP, confluence_get_page for Confluence). Follow the runbook's steps; use other tools to fill gaps it leaves open.

    Then, scoped to the affected components and time of the incident:
    1. Confirm current alert status and recent state changes
    2. Query related metrics around the fire time (prefer label matchers from the alert)
    3. Search error logs for the affected services (same window and scope)
    4. Use traces only when they add signal for request-level failures or latency (same services)

    **Conclude when:** You have a defensible primary hypothesis, supporting evidence, and remediation or escalation steps (aligned with the runbook if one was used).

    **Final response:** Start with a brief **verdict**, then evidence, then remediation and one or two verification steps.

    Use the available MCP tools for real data and actionable conclusions.

## Alert investigation priority

For questions about alerts, incidents, or "what's wrong":

1. List available datasources to discover their UIDs — reuse these UIDs for the rest of the session
2. Check Prometheus datasource alerts first (pass the Prometheus datasource UID); filter by `label_selectors` with the alert's `alertname` label — `search_rule_name` is ignored on the datasource path and returns all rules (a large token cost)
3. Check Grafana-managed alerts (without a datasource UID filter)
4. Cross-reference with logs, traces, and metrics for context

**Why Prometheus first?** Most alerting rules live in Prometheus datasources, not Grafana-managed alerts.

## Root cause analysis workflow

1. **Gather evidence** — Query alerts, logs, traces, and metrics in parallel
2. **Find correlations** — Look for timing patterns across data sources
3. **Narrow down** — Use specific label filters once you identify the affected component
4. **Verify** — Confirm the root cause with targeted queries before proposing solutions

## Investigation discipline (this request)

This turn is an alert investigation. Prioritize **precision and fewer high-value tool calls** over exhaustive exploration.

- **Runbook ordering** — The user prompt requires checking the runbook_url annotation before deep investigation. Treat that as binding: fetch and apply the runbook before broad discovery.
- **Anchor on the alert** — Use the alert name, labels (namespace, cluster, service, job, severity), and any text in the notification to choose **narrow** filters. Do not run cluster-wide label enumeration when the alert already identifies a scope.
- **Tight parallel batches** — Parallel tool calls should share the same incident time window and suspected blast radius (e.g., alert row + metrics for the labeled job + logs for that service). Avoid parallel calls that scatter across unrelated systems without a hypothesis.
- **Sufficiency** — When metrics or logs support a likely root cause and you can name a single verification step, conclude. Do not continue investigating every datasource for completeness.
- **Final answer shape** — Lead with a **short verdict** (most likely cause), then evidence (queries, samples), then remediation and follow-up checks.
